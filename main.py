"""The requirements to advance to COP3504C was recently updated and has become more stringent with the recent demand for CS degrees. Unfortunately, I (and several other students with prior knowledge in the course I've talked to) felt that the information in the course was repetitiveâ€”especially at the start of the course. I'm not an extremely experienced programmer and the tail end of the course DID teach me new information (such as Big O notation and basic algorithms). I've picked up an amateur's experience in full stack web development with MySQL, PHP, front-end, and Django. (I've spent about 2,500 hours in total working on a click-to-deploy peer tutoring website in High School) Although I've never had a formal education (and, again, I did learn many new things in this course), I felt that the exercises I had to do was mostly frustrating busy-work. During the first month of the semester, I was interested in machine learning. I remember waiting for Zybooks to finish animating a demonstration of print("Hello World") while I was working on code to train a convolutional neural network to detect, using sound from stereo microphone inputs, the approximate positions of viral symptoms like coughs and sneezes in an auditorium. I want to clarify that I don't see myself as someone who is "too good for school." I did appreciate the formal education and review of certain topics in Python, but I feel that I could have had this review with a much better-matched pacing if I was in COP3504C. 
 

I've emailed several advising offices and professors to try to advance to COP3504C, but I was repeatedly denied for not having an AP CS A score of 4 or higher. It seems like "prior experience" was a substitute for this requirement in past years and they've removed that pathway in response to overwhelming demand right as I entered UF as a freshman this year. I think it would be more efficient for students' tuition and time purposes if more resources were allocated to teaching the advanced course as high school programming experience is becoming more common with resources such as GitHub student pack and the more competitive admissions scene. Every quiz was a comical 20 minute review of the study guide and then a 20 minute quiz. Those 40 minutes in addition to maybe two hours attending the mandatory lab was all the weekly work I did for this class for the majority of the semester. I spent more time on my 1 credit-hour ethics class than this class. In other words, I didn't feel like I've learned 4-credit hours worth of information: my tuition money and time was wasted.

I understand the other major behind why they removed "prior experience" as a substitute for the CS score: some students in past years made it into the class with overblown confidence and fell flat on their faces.

I don't understand why an ALEKS-like benchmark exam can't help students figure out if they can advance."""

"""I would like to say some words about the COP3504C requirements here because, sadly, I don't feel like I'm being heard when I bring it up with administration.

The requirements to advance to COP3504C was recently updated and has become more stringent possibly partially due to the recent uptick in demand for CS degrees. Unfortunately, I (and several other students who tried to switch to COP3504) felt that the information in the course was repetitiveâ€”especially at the start of the course. I'm not an extremely experienced programmer and the tail end of the course DID teach me new information (such as Big O notation and basic algorithms). I've picked up an amateur's experience in full stack web development with MySQL, PHP, front-end, and Django.

During drop/add and at the beginning of the semester, I've emailed several advising offices and professors to try to advance to COP3504C, but I was repeatedly denied for not having an AP CS A score of 4 or higher. It seems like "prior experience" was a substitute for this requirement in past years and they've removed that pathway in response to overwhelming demand right as I entered UF as a freshman this year. I think it would be more efficient for students' tuition and time purposes if more resources were allocated to teaching the advanced course as high school programming experience is becoming more common with resources such as GitHub student pack and the more competitive admissions scene.

I spent more time on my 1 credit-hour ethics class than this class. In other words, I didn't feel like I've learned 4-credit hours worth of information: my tuition money and time was wasted.

A former COP3504C professor told me of another reason as to why "prior experience" was removed as a substitute for the CS score: some students in past years made it into the class with insufficient prior experience and struggled.

I don't understand why UF won't allocate additional resources to teaching more COP3504C sections and design an ALEKS-like benchmark exam to determine whether students can advance. Of course, the volume of students has intensified over the last few years and maybe there's some logistical issues I don't know about, but the current situation as I experience it does not tell me that UF's plan to become an "AI" university is student-focused."""
