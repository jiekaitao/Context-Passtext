# Context-Passtext

A simple python program that listens to your computer microphone to pick up the last 5 minutes or so of any video lectures and your spoken word.
Optimized MacOS... you may have to change some libraries (particularly for keypress monitoring) if you use any other operating system.

# Usage:

Run this program, and when you have some confusion on what your video lecture, pause the video and say your question. Finally, press CTRL + q and wait about 3 seconds for the voice to say "copied a question."
This takes a screenshot of your primary monitor, passes in the last five minutes of your lecturer's words, and your question to ChatGPT.
